        His next film, the book-to-screen adaptation Bee Season (2005), was a commercial failure.[22] Gere went on to co-star with Jesse Eisenberg and Terrence Howard in The Hunting Party (2007),
        a thriller in which he played a journalist in Bosnia. He next appeared with Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett in Todd Haynes' semi-biographical film about Bob Dylan,

        The film is his most recent to have been produced entirely by a major film studio.

        Gere has expressed a belief that his politics regarding China, an important financial resource for major Hollywood studios,
        have made him unwelcome within Hollywood.[26] He embraced his apparent exile from Hollywood and instead appeared in independent films
        that garnered some of the best reviews of his career.<sup>[18]</sup> He was notably singled out for portraying businessman Robert Miller in Arbitrage (2012),
        earning his fourth Golden Globe Award nomination. Among many positive reviews,[27] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone cited Gere's performance as "too good to ignore" and "an implosive tour de force".[28] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post further wrote that he "gives the best performance of his career".[29] Also in 2012, he received the Golden Starfish Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Hamptons International Film Festival and the Career Achievement Award from the Hollywood Film Awards.[30][31] He had earlier received an award from the 34th Cairo International Film Festival in December 2010.[32]

        Gere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with Joseph Cedar's political drama Norman (2016).
        The film saw him portray Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish fixer. Gere himself described the character as an embodiment of the "sides of us we know are annoying and needy".
        [33] His portrayal of Oppenheimer was called "consistently, completely fascinating" by RogerEbert.com[34] and was singled out as a worthy Academy Award contender by Variety.[35]

    <p>
        Gere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the Pretty Woman piano theme and a guitar solo in Runaway Bride.
        He learned tap dance for his role as lawyer Billy Flynn in Chicago,[36] and karate for <i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i>.[37]

    <p>
        Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Gere as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.[38][39]
